# Live Text Share

Live edit text between multiple users.

To see how it works, open up two tabs pointed at [an example room](http://austinheiman.com:3000/room-name-here). The URL pathname must be identical. Any browser at the same path as yours will be able to edit the text in your browser.



```shell
$ npm install    # install dependencies into node_modules
$ node index.js  # run the app, log to console

# deploy (run in background, log to nohup.out):
$ nohup nodejs index.js &
```
